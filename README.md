# CSMM103X-Robotics
This repository includes the projects of CSMM103X - Robotics course offered by Columbia University.

1. Project 1
  - The code will subscribe to a topic called 'two_ints' , on which a custom message containing two integers can be broadcast.
  - Those two integers are to be added and the result published to topic 'sum' as an Int16 from std_msgs.
2. Project 2
  -  This project will introduce you to 'tf', the ROS framework for handling transforms. 
  -  In this project, we consider a ROS ecosystem, which consists of a robot with a camera mounted on it as well as an object.
